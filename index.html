Are you curious about how all these beautiful things we see in the universe came into existence? <br> 
Well, if you are, you’re reading the right article. <br>
Through this essay, I will tell you all how our vast universe came into existence. <br>
There were two theories about how the universe came into existence. <br>
Currently, only one is accepted worldwide. <br>

In this essay, I shall explain both of the theories to you, and also why one is more accepted and why the other is not. <br>
Let me start by explaining the theory that is more accepted. It is called ‘The Big Bang Theory’. <br>
I am sure you must have heard that name, but you might not know what exactly that is. <br>
The Big Bang Theory was devised in 1927 by a Belgian astronomer named Abbe G. Lemaitre. <br> 
As there were arguments, in 1929, Edwin Hubble proved the theory right, by observing the motion of the galaxies and stars. <br>
He stated that all the matter in the universe was stored in a really microscopic ball. <br>
It then violently exploded in a Big Bang! <br>
The Big Bang happened about 13.7 billion years ago. <br>


Since then, the universe has been expanding rapidly. <br>
The temperature of the universe at the time of the Big Bang was 180 MTT degrees, which is more than a trillion times hotter than our sun’s core. <br> 
The time after the Big Bang was divided into two eras and multiple epochs. <br>
The first era lasted for about 20 minutes. But the second era is still going on. <br>
There were different epochs after the Big Bang, and most lasted for a really, really short time. <br>
But some epochs lasted longer than the others. Here is the epoch timeline: <br>

The first 20 minutes after the Big Bang were divided into 6 epochs. They were: <br>
1) Planck Epoch <br>
2) Grand Unification Epoch <br>
3) Electroweak Epoch <br>
4) Quark Epoch <br>
5) Hadron Epoch <br>
6) Photon Epoch <br>

<h1> THE PLANCK EPOCH </h1> <br>
This period lasted for 1E-43 seconds, and the universe expanded 1E-35 meters. <br>
This had a temperature of 1E+32 degrees Celsius. <br>
There were four fundamental forces at this time. They were: <br>
1)Electromagnetism <br>
2) Weak Nuclear Force <br>
3) Strong Nuclear Force <br>
4) Gravity <br>
All of these forces had equal power at that time. <br>
They could also have been unified into one single force, which was as symmetrical as a pencil standing on its tip, which can last only a nanosecond. <br>

<h1> THE GRAND UNIFICATION EPOCH </h1> <br>
This epoch lasted for 1E-7 seconds. <br>
The only change that happened here was a major one, when the force of gravity separated from the other forces. <br>


<h1>THE ELECTROWEAK EPOCH </h1> <br>
This epoch lasted for 1E-24 seconds. Here, the strong nuclear force splits from the fundamental forces. <br>
This sends a wave of particles. <br>
As they interact, they create bosons W, Z and Higgs. <br>
These bosons create the first ‘Mass’. <br>


<h1> THE QUARK EPOCH </h1> <br>
This epoch lasted for 1E-6 seconds. <br>
This was when quarks, electrons, neutrons, and antiquarks came into existence. <br>
The universe cools off to less than a quadrillion degrees Celsius. <br>
The forces assume their forms as they are now. <br>

<h1>THE HADRON EPOCH </h1> <br>
This epoch lasted for 1E-4 seconds. <br>
This was when the first second after the Big Bang was elapsed. <br>
The temperature cools to a trillion degrees Celsius, and protons and electrons form. <br>
The proton, neutron, and electron combined to form the very first nucleus/atom. <br>


<h1> THE PHOTON EPOCH </h1> <br>
This epoch lasted for 240,000 years, when all the other particles except nuclei were gone. <br>
The cosmos was filled with plasma, and photons ruled the universe. <br>
The photon epoch marked the end of the current era. <br>

The next era in the list is the matter era. <br>
Let me tell you more about it. <br>
It is divided into 3 stages. <br>
1) Dark Age <br>
2) Star and Galaxy Formation <br>
3) Solar System Formation <br>


<h1> DARK AGE </h1> <br>
This stage lasted for 150 million years. <br>
At this time, the universe was fully dark with no stars formed to give away light. <br>


<h31 STAR AND GALAXY FORMATION </h1> <br>
This lasted for 200 million years and it was when the first light came into the universe after 150M years. <br>
Stars like Aldebaran and galaxies like Sombrero started to form. <br>
The galaxies and stars take their present form. <br>


<h1> SOLAR SYSTEM FORMATION </h1> <br>
This lasted for half a million years, eight billion years after the Big Bang, and four billion years ago. <br>
The Sun formed, followed by the planets and moons. <br>


<h1>TODAY </h1> <br>
After 13.7 Billion Years: The stars and galaxies still form and the universe is ever-expanding. <br>
We predict that one day, the tension will be too much and the whole universe will collapse, the next one will begin with another BIG BANG!
